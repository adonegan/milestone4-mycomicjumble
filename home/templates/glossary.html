            <div class="content collapse-text">
                <p class="my-2">A perfect copy with no defects.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Near Mint</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A nearly perfect copy that looks brand new with only a few very minor defects.
                    Acceptable minor defects on a Near Mint copy include: a very small amount of spine stresses, very minor
                    instances of denting (two or three at most), slight corner blunting, and minor (less than 1/8")
                    bends without color breaks.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Very Fine</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A Very Fine copy has minor defects, but is in overall excellent condition. Most well-kept
                    modern comics (especially if they have been read) fall into this grade. Acceptable defects on a Very Fine
                    are minor and include: minor corner wear, a light accumulation of spine stress that may include
                    color-break, a light accumulation of dents, and bends or folds less than 1/4" (note that on a Very Fine
                    copy, some color-break is allowed in a bend/fold).</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Fine</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A comic in Fine condition is considered "above average" but still displays some wear. In
                    general, the eye appeal is somewhat reduced due to either an accumulation of minor defects or one or
                    two moderate defects. Acceptable defects on a Fine copy include: Slight spine roll, a moderate
                    accumulation of spine stresses that may break color, a spine split of less than 1/2", minor water
                    spotting or residue (less than the size of a dime), an impacted corner, and moderate foxing.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Very Good</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A comic in Very Good condition shows some significant wear, but has not accumulated enough
                    total defects to reduce eye appeal to the point that it is not a desirable copy. A Very Good copy may have
                    an accumulation of minor defects or one or two major ones. Acceptable defects on a Very Good copy include:
                    Spine roll, 1/2" to 1" spine splits or other tears, a cover or centerfold that is detached at one
                    staple, discoloration due to oxidation, and a moderate accumulation of water damage or staining.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Good</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A Good copy has major defects, but is still complete and readable. A Good copy will have a
                    significant amount of damage, usually an accumulation of smaller defects punctuated with some major
                    defects. Acceptable defects on a Good copy include: a vertical book-length crease, 1.5"-2" spine
                    split, cover or centerfold completely detached, major tears, heavy discoloration/brittleness due to
                    oxidation, heavy amounts of staining, residue, and water damage.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Fair</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A Fair is the lowest grade a comic book can receive as long as the story and art are
                    complete. A Fair copy will have virtually no eye appeal and will display major damage. A comic book in
                    Fair condition may have non-story elements such as coupons, ad pages, or Marvel Value Stamps cut or
                    torn out of the book. Types of damage that place a comic in Fair range include: A spine split of up to
                    2/3 the length of the book, a missing back cover provided the front cover is still attached, severe
                    water damage or residue damage, mold, and paper deterioration due to oxidation.</p>

            <div class="content collapse-text mb-4 text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">Comic books in Poor condition may be missing up to 4 pages (two spreads) of story pages or
                    display severe damage that affects the readability of the book.</p>

            <button class="collapsible card-text">Bend</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">When part of a comic is curved, interrupting the flat, smooth cover surface. Bends will
                    not show distinct lines.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Crease</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A fold that causes ink removal/color break, usually resulting in a white line.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Denting</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">Indentations or dimpling (usually in the cover) that don't penetrate the paper or remove
                    any gloss, but do interrupt the smooth, flat surface.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Dust Shadow</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">When a comic has been stored in a stack at some point in its life, any portions of the
                    cover that weren't covered up by the adjacent books have been exposed to environmental air, light,
                    and settling dust particles, sometimes creating lines of discoloration along the edges.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Fingerprints</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">When finger oils left behind from everyday handling remain on a comic's surface, they
                    can begin to eat away at the ink, literally creating color-breaking fingerprints on the cover that
                    are sometimes distinct and sometimes smudged. Finger oils can usually be wiped away, but
                    fingerprints are irreversible.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Spine Break</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A spine stress that has devolved into a tear (usually through multiple wraps). Spine
                    breaks greatly decrease the spine's structural integrity and are often found close to the staples.
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Staple Detached</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">When a wrap has come completely loose from a staple and is no longer bound to the comic
                    in that area.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible card-text">Reading Crease</button>
            <div class="content collapse-text mb-4 text-justify">
                <p class="my-2">A vertical cover crease near the staples that runs (generally) parallel to the spine,
                    caused by bending the cover over the staples or just too far to the left. Squarebound books get
                    these very easily.</p>
