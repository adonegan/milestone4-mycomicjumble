- Use my credit card at checkout to purchase what I want
- Give feedback or leave a note on what I think about the site and the collection of comics
- Search for comics on the store by name and category
- Click buttons to easily see comics by category

- Find out the grade and condition of the issue I want to buy
- Be able to register to the website and then login to my own account

### Continous Integration

From the beginning of this project, Continuous Integration - which means to test code in smaller chunks more often - was employed. In this project, Travis was used. To set this up, you'll need an account with Travis > connect it to the Github repository. Add a .yml file to the root directory of your project, where language, version, requirements and script are specified. Then the first build takes place, which takes a few seconds as Travis tests all the code submitted. A build icon is placed at the top of this README.md file and is used to keep track of passing or failing code.
